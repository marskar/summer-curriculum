# Background
We are international cancer researchers and clinicians working in the field of cancer prevention and that we have gathered some of our colleagues to develop a primary cancer prevention strategy. Our goal is to design the intervention in one country with the idea that it could later be adapted to other countries. Our goal is to increase HPV vaccination rates for cervical cancer prevention.

An effective national prevention program will be composed of strategies to reduce cancer incidence and mortality that incorporate program evaluation, are sustainable in the long-term and cost-effective, and benefit as much of the population as possible.

# Stakeholders

- Central and state governments
- Family and Health Welfare Ministry workers
- The district mayors
- Pediatrician / Gynecologist
- School teachers
- Primary healthcare workers
- Parents
- Patient Advocates

# Target Population

For improved HPV vaccination rates, our target population will be 

- children, 
- 9-16 years old, 
- in all schools nationwide, and also 
- at the primary health center nationwide, on an ongoing basis.

# Objectives

1. We will identify the stakeholders and form a working committee by 2019.
2. We will work with the central government to approve the HPV vaccination program for high schoolers by 2020.
3. The working committee will pilot the program to validate the education program for kids and teachers by 2020.
4. We will work with the central government to implement the HPV vaccination program by 2021.
5. Everyone involved will aim to vaccinate at least 40 percent of the population by 2022.

# Education

- Mass communication (TV, Newspapers, Radio, Internet)
- Involving celebrities for campaigning
- Advertisements in 
    - public transportation, 
    - schools/universities, and 
    - shopping malls


# Barriers

- Cost
- Perception of adverse effects and risks
- Allergies (to vaccines in general and yeast, which is a component of Gardasil)


# 6. Program Evaluation

- Vaccination rate (Short-Term)
    - According to school and health center registries
- Cervical Cancer Incidence Rate (Long-Term)
    - by cancer registry program

Process: Was a national strategy created? Was funding allocated? How many individuals saw the adverts?

Outcome: Did the average school-age child vaccination rate increase?

Impact: Over time, does Indiaâ€™s vaccination rate increase? Do cervical cancer incidence rates decline?
