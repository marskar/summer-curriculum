# Background
We are international cancer researchers and clinicians working in the field of cancer prevention and that we have gathered some of our colleagues to develop a primary cancer prevention strategy. Our goal is to design the intervention in one country with the idea that it could later be adapted to other countries. Our goal is to increase HPV vaccination rates for cervical cancer prevention.

An effective national prevention program will be composed of strategies to reduce cancer incidence and mortality that incorporate program evaluation, are sustainable in the long-term and cost-effective, and benefit as much of the population as possible.

# Stakeholders

- Central and state governments.
- The district mayor
- Pediatrician / Gynecologist
- School teachers
- Primary healthcare workers
- Parents

# Target Population

For improved HPV vaccination rates, our target population will be 

- children, 
- 9-16 years old, 
- in all schools nationwide and also 
- at the primary health center nationwide, on an ongoing basis.

# Objectives

1. Identify the stakeholders and form a working committee by 2019.
2. To approve the HPV vaccination program for high schoolers by 2020.
3. Pilot program to valid the education program for kids and teachers.
4. To implement the HPV vaccination program by 2021.
5. To vaccinate at least 40 percent of the population by 2022.

# Education

- Mass communication (TV, Newspapers, Radio, Internet)
- Involving celebrities for campaigning
- Advertisements in 
    - public transportation, 
    - schools/universities, and 
    - shopping malls


# Barriers

- Cost
- Perception of adverse effects and risks
- Allergies (to vaccines in general and yeast, which is a component of Gardasil)

The tanning bed and/or outdoor recreation industries may lobby against this campaign. Individuals may not be able to afford sunscreen. These barriers could be addressed by enlisting the support of health organizations and local leaders to gain public support for the campaign, and by subsidizing skin protection products for individuals receiving government welfare benefits.

# 6. Program Evaluation

- Vaccination rate (Short-Term)
- Cervical Cancer Incidence Rate (Long-Term)
- Eradication

Process: Was a national strategy created? Was funding allocated? How many posters were mailed, how many individuals saw the social media messages, how many individuals received free sunscreen?
Outcome: Does the average school-age child apply sunscreen or wear a hat more frequently? Impact: Over years if not decades, do Australiaâ€™s melanoma incidence and mortality rates decline?
